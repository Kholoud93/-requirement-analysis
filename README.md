Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Welcome!
This repository is dedicated to breaking down the what, why, and how of requirement analysis in software development. If you’re tired of projects that miss the mark, blow up in scope, or just straight-up flop, this is the read for you. Here, you’ll find the fundamentals, real-world examples, and a touch of Gen Z “tell it like it is” perspective.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of discovering, analyzing, documenting, and validating what a software system needs to do. It’s basically where you figure out:

What problems you’re solving

What features and functions the system should have

What constraints you have to work within

It’s critical in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because getting this stage wrong means you’ll spend the rest of your project fixing mistakes, fighting with clients, or building stuff nobody wants.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Prevents Scope Creep:
By clearly defining what the system should and should not do, you stop the project from spiraling into an endless list of features nobody asked for.

Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction:
You can’t hit a target if you don’t know what it is. Requirement analysis makes sure everyone is on the same page—users, developers, managers, everyone.

Saves Time & Money:
Fixing requirements issues late in the project is expensive. Nail them early, and you’ll ship faster and avoid awkward “uhhh…this isn’t what I wanted” meetings.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering:
Collecting all the info—user needs, business objectives, system constraints—through interviews, surveys, or observation.

Requirement Elicitation:
Digging deeper with brainstorming sessions, workshops, and use cases to uncover hidden or unstated needs.

Requirement Documentation:
Writing everything down clearly—think requirement specs, user stories, diagrams.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
Breaking down and structuring requirements; using models like use case diagrams or flowcharts to visualize and clarify.

Requirement Validation:
Double-checking everything with stakeholders to ensure the requirements are correct, complete, and realistic.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements
These are the what: what features, actions, or behaviors the system must provide.
Examples for a booking management project:

Users can search for available properties.

The system supports user registration and secure login.

Users can book, modify, or cancel reservations.

Admins can manage property listings.

Non-functional Requirements
These are the how: how well the system performs, its qualities, and constraints.
Examples:

The system must load property search results in under 2 seconds.

User data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

The platform should support at least 10,000 concurrent users.

All features must be mobile-responsive.

Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are visual tools that show how users (actors) interact with a system.
They help you spot all the ways users and external systems will use your application—and make sure you’re not missing any major workflows.

Benefits:

Make complex systems easier to understand

Help identify all user roles and system interactions

Serve as a foundation for building user stories and acceptance criteria

Example: Booking System Use Case Diagram



(Tip: Create this in Draw.io or similar, then export and link it here! Typical actors: Guest/User, Admin, Payment System. Typical use cases: Register, Login, Search Property, Book Property, Checkout, Manage Booking, etc.)

Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are the specific conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.
They keep everyone honest—if the criteria aren’t met, the feature isn’t “done,” period.

Why are Acceptance Criteria important?

Remove ambiguity and set clear expectations

Serve as the definition of “done” for each feature

Help QA and developers know exactly what to test for

Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria

User can review all booking details before confirming payment

Payment is processed securely and user receives confirmation within 5 seconds

Error message displayed if payment fails, with retry option

Booking is added to user’s history after successful checkout
